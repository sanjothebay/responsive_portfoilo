                    Dear Future Company,
                    </br>
                    Throughout my career, I have contributed to positive
                    business results through effective organization,
                    prioritization and follow-through of key organizational
                    projects. My strengths and qualifications are an ideal
                    match for the Service Desk Technician requirements and
                    will bring immediate value to the Company
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my former Service Desk Technician role, I exercised a
                    calculated and methodical approach to problem-solving.
                    While I am independently motivated, I appreciate
                    collective efforts and collaborate productively within
                    group settings. Moreover, I am competent in writing and
                    data analysis with proficiency in process development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opportunity is especially exciting as my professional
                    goals align with the IT Industry mission and values. Further,
                    my customer service, critical thinking and problem-solving
                    abilities will serve to support your continued organizational
                    efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To illustrate the scope of my career history and
                    professional competencies, please take a moment to
                    review my enclosed resume. I am grateful for your
                    evaluation of my credentials and subsequent response.
