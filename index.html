            Dear Future Company,
            Throughout my career, I have contributed to positive
            business results through effective organization,
            prioritization and follow-through of key organizational
            projects. My strengths and qualifications are an ideal
            match for the Service Desk Technician requirements and
            will bring immediate value to the Company
        </p>
        <p>
            In my former Service Desk Technician role, I exercised a
            calculated and methodical approach to problem-solving.
            While I am independently motivated, I appreciate
            collective efforts and collaborate productively within
            group settings. Moreover, I am competent in writing and
            data analysis with proficiency in process development.
        </p>
        <p>
            This opportunity is especially exciting as my professional
            goals align with the IT Industry mission and values. Further,
            my customer service, critical thinking and problem-solving
            abilities will serve to support your continued organizational
            efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            To illustrate the scope of my career history and
            professional competencies, please take a moment to
            review my enclosed resume. I am grateful for your
